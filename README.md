# refuge-api

This is an API implementation for the Refuge IT System landscape.

For API Reference and Live Endpoint, check out:
[Refuge Live API](https://refuge-api.herokuapp.com)

Live API is deployed on Heroku.

Swagger API is autogenerated with express-oas-generator.

Base API URL: https://refuge-api.herokuapp.com

Direct Link to Swagger Documentation: https://refuge-api.herokuapp.com/api-docs

This API uses [passportjs](http://www.passportjs.org/) for Authentication.
Current implementation works with JWT Tokens. Will be extended later to also include Google Login.

To run the tests, type npm test.

To start the server, type npm start.
Beware though, currently, start script is setup to
migrate to latest changes and restore all default
DB values on start. You might want to change those in production.

You need to have a .env file for environemental settings.
Currently, there are three keys you need to be set:

    HOST
    PORT
    SECRET

For retrieving settings from .env, dotenv is used.

Testing libary used is: Mochajs with Chai.

## DB Initialization
This project uses sequelize as an ORM with SQlite as a light-weight DB.
Migrations as well as seeds can be run for three different environements

- test
- development
- production

Use --env flag to determine for which environement to run (for migrations as well as seeds). Default
is "development" (i.e. no flag).

You can find more details here: http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/migrations.html

### Migrations
To run sequlize migrations for initial DB Setup (values in [] are optional, values in <> are possible values), type:

    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate [--env <test|development|production>]
    
### Seeds
To run sequelize seed operation for initial DB Setup (values in [] are optional, values in <> are possible values), type:

    npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all [--env <test|development|production>]
    
### Examples
Test DB Setup Example:

    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
    npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all --env test

Migrates and seeds test database.

## Testing
